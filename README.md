This is an app that allows for an online game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
This is facilitated by the Firebase DB and allows for 2 players to compete in a game as old as hands.
Whichever player joins first will be on the left side as player 1, whereas the second will be on the right; any further players that join will find that the player's view is obscured.
